        &emsp;I am a passionate Software Engineer with three years of experience
        in developing scalable and efficient web and mobile applications. With a
        strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I have
        successfully implemented solutions that enhance user experience and
        streamline data management. My expertise spans a range of programming
        languages and frameworks, including React, Node.js, and Spring Boot, and
        I am proficient in database management with both SQL and NoSQL systems.
        Throughout my career, I have been involved in the complete Software
        Development Life Cycle (SDLC), actively participating in Agile practices
        such as Scrum and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams to ensure
        timely delivery of high-quality digital products. I thrive in dynamic
        environments where I can leverage my skills in API development, UI
        component creation, and automated testing to drive innovation. My most
        recent achievement was being the sole full-stack developer for
        Bytekitchen in which I learned all 4 web applications and 2 KDS
        applications and their technologies in order to accomodate the
        acquisition of the company into the Lightspeed suite of products. I was
        then able to provide guidance, develop, and provide documentation to cut
        down on development time and ideation.
